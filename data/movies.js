      "Seun is posted to do his National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) in Benue state, with his place of Primary Assignment (PPA) in Buruku local government, where he was warmly and heartedly received by the community people with the approval of the Chief in charge of the community. Not only did Seun find the culture of the Tiv unusually hospitable, he also found the daughter of the Chief, Sena, valuable enough to be the wife he wants to spend the rest of his life with. But this desire is met with trembling adversity from someone who would stand his ground to see that his childhood love is not married out to an estranged corper who thinks he is qualified to marry the chief's daughter because of the community acceptance.",
